# Chapter 2: Human-Robot Interaction in Unity (Who?)

## Goal

Render realistic humanoids and simulate social scenarios.

## Topics

- Why visual realism matters (proxemics, HRI research)
- Unity vs. Gazebo (high-fidelity rendering for HRI)
- Social robotics (personal space, eye contact, gestures)
- Designing for social acceptance

## Code Examples

1. Render humanoid in Unity with high-quality materials
2. Simulate proxemics zones (intimate, personal, social, public)
3. Validate HRI behaviors (greeting, maintaining distance)

## Learning Outcome

Build an HRI scenario where the robot maintains appropriate social distance and displays believable human-like behaviors.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:

- Completed **Chapter 1: Physics with Gazebo**
- Access to Unity 2021 LTS+ (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Basic understanding of game engine workflows

## Building on Gazebo

In Chapter 1, you validated physics. Now you'll add visual realism using Unity's rendering capabilities while maintaining the physics fidelity from Gazebo.

## Integration with ROS 2

This chapter shows how to bridge Unity with ROS 2 to:

- Stream sensor data from Gazebo into Unity
- Visualize humanoid motion in real-time
- Test HRI behaviors before deployment

---

## Social Robotics Concepts

Key learning points include:

- **Proxemics**: Personal space zones and how robots should respect them
- **Eye contact and gaze**: How robots communicate non-verbally
- **Gesture recognition**: Interpreting and responding to human gestures
- **Believability**: Making robot motion feel natural, not uncanny

---

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll:

- Understand the complementary roles of Gazebo and Unity
- Be ready for **Chapter 3: Sensors & Sim-to-Real Gaps**
- Have experience with realistic HRI scenario design

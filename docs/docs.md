# The Robotic Nervous System: ROS 2 for Humanoid AI

Welcome to a university-level textbook on **ROS 2 middleware** — the distributed system that enables AI agents to control humanoid robots.

## What You'll Learn

This module teaches ROS 2 through the lens of **humanoid robotics**:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System**
  - Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2 and Robotic Middleware
  - Chapter 2: ROS 2 Communication — Nodes, Topics, and Services
  - Chapter 3: Python AI Agents, rclpy, and Humanoid Descriptions (URDF)

## Target Audience

- Advanced undergraduate or graduate students in Computer Science or Robotics
- Prior programming experience required (Python preferred)
- Basic understanding of distributed systems helpful
- No prior ROS experience needed

## Learning Approach

This textbook follows a **"blackbox then whitebox"** pedagogy:

1. **Blackbox**: Understand ROS 2's purpose and role in humanoid robotics
2. **Whitebox**: Learn the internals — nodes, topics, services, and communication patterns
3. **Practical**: Write Python agents using rclpy and integrate with URDF robot descriptions

## Navigation

- Start with **Module 1** above to begin learning ROS 2 as middleware
- Each chapter includes:
  - Clear learning objectives
  - Core concepts explained progressively
  - Architecture diagrams and practical examples
  - Real-world humanoid robot use cases
  - Review questions for self-assessment

## Language Support

This textbook is available in:
- **English** (default)
- **اردو** (Urdu) — one-click language switching in the navigation bar

## Prerequisites

- **Programming**: Python 3.11 or equivalent
- **Systems**: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+), WSL2, or Docker
- **Knowledge**: Familiarity with command-line terminals and basic networking concepts

### Setting Up Your Environment

Before reading Chapter 1, follow the [Quick Start Guide](../specs/001-ros2-nervous-system/quickstart.md) to install ROS 2 Humble:

- **Option 1**: Install locally on Ubuntu 22.04
- **Option 2**: Use Docker with `osrf/ros:humble-desktop`

## About This Book

This textbook is **AI-authored using Claude** and follows **Spec-Driven Development** principles:

- **Specification-First**: All content flows from explicit learning objectives and requirements
- **Technical Accuracy**: Every claim is verified against official ROS 2 documentation
- **Reproducible**: Generated from specifications; deployable to Docusaurus without manual fixes
- **Tested**: Code examples are syntactically correct; review questions are answerable from chapter content
